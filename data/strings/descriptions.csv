#faction,,,,,,
solvaris,FACTION,"The Solvaris Remnants were once rulers of the stars, their fleets dominant and their influence vast. But their reign was cut short by betrayal. A coalition of envious rivals launched a sudden and devastating assault, dismantling their fleets, burning their worlds, and seizing their territories. In mere cycles, their civilization was wiped from the star maps, their people scattered or enslaved. The galaxy moved on, believing the Solvaris to be nothing more than a forgotten legend. But while their enemies divided the spoils of war, a handful of survivors vanished into the void. These remnants soldiers, tacticians, and exiled leaders refused to accept extinction. Hiding in the depths of space, they became ghosts, salvaging lost technology, training in secret, and striking from the shadows.

Centuries passed, and the factions that had betrayed them fell into decay, consumed by infighting and greed. The once-mighty conquerors had grown complacent, their stolen worlds now crumbling under misrule. But the Solvaris Remnants never forgot. For generations, they have prepared, watching and waiting for the moment to rise. Though their fleets are few, they strike with lethal precision. Though their numbers are small, their resolve is unbreakable. They have no throne, no home, only a mission to reclaim what was stolen, to restore their lost sovereignty, and to remind the galaxy that the Solvaris were never truly defeated. Now, their banners rise once more, and nothing will stand in their way.",,,,
